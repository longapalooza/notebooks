    "# Raspberry Pi Primer\n",
    "There are few things to realize before beginning to work with a Raspberry Pi. First, the Pi is a full fledge computer. Computer being the common term of a computer. Not just a device that computes but a computer in the sense of something similar to your laptop or desktop computer. The Arduino is typically described as a computer but it's only a computer in the sense that it is able to compute. This is not the case with the Pi. The second thing to realize about the Pi is that although it is a full fledge computer, it has certain microcontroller characteristics. It has a [GPIO pins](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-gpio/gpio-pinout) similar to the Arduino. It is capable of serial, I2C, PWM, and SPI communications. It however does not have an analog to digital converter (ADC). If you need to process an analog signal, you must use a separate ADC to do that (see [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15334) for one/Note: This ADC uses the [QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and you may need additional hardware to use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main ways to use a Pi, using a desktop environment (DE) and using the command line interface (CLI). Below is a quick summary of the pros and cons of using each.\n",
    "## Desktop enironment:\n",
    "### Pro\n",
    "* Very similar to using a regular computer (i.e. mouse and keyboard interactions)\n",
    "* Many programs only work on a DE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Con\n",
    "* Resource heavy (storage space, memory, cpu, etc.)\n",
    "* Often times a DE is not necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command line interface:\n",
    "### Pro\n",
    "* Utilizes little system resources (storage space, memory, cpu, etc.)\n",
    "* More professional\n",
    "\n",
    "### Con\n",
    "* No mouse, you must type everything as a command\n",
    "* Can be quite an adjustment from other computer tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "I would actually encourage just using the CLI. Once you overcome the initial fear of using the CLI, it is not so bad. Regardless of whether you use a DE or the CLI, you will at some point have to using the CLI so you might as well start off with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided whether you are going to go with the DE or CLI, you can go ahead and install the operating system (OS) for the Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Operating System Installation\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "* Raspbian zip file found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)\n",
    "* balenaEtcher found [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)\n",
    "* &gt; 8GB microSD card\n",
    "* microSD card reader (microSD to USB or microSD to SD adapter)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS that the Pi uses is called Raspbian and is a fork from the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux distribution (Raspberry + Debian = Raspbian). On the Raspbian download page, there are 3 options of download\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster with desktop\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster Lite\n",
    "\n",
    "Buster is the current version of Raspbian (just like Windows 10 is the current version of Windows operating system). The 3 options are what the names imply. Option 1 comes with the DE and other useful software when using a DE. This option includes software packages like a LibreOffice (think MS Office/Word, Excel, etc.), image editing software, games, etc. Option 1 is good for the case where you are using the Pi as a desktop computer. This option can be a little bloated if you are using the Pi for an embedded system. Option 2 is good for an embedded system where you still want a DE. Option 3 is for the case where you only have the CLI. Whichever option selected be sure to select the `Download ZIP` option. You could down the file via a torrent but that's another lesson. The download could a take a little while to download depending on which version you select. Since the download takes a little while, I typically move the ZIP file to a safe location when it finishes downloading so that I don't have to download it time and time again.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Raspbian ZIP file is downloading, you can download Etcher. Etcher is an image file writer. The zip file that you download is a compressed version of what is called an image file. An image file is \"copy\" of all the files necessary for the OS to work properly. There is more to an image file than simply copying the files from one place to another but that is basically the idea. Etcher handles the \"copying\" of the image file correctly. To use Etcher, you need to first point it to the location of the Raspbian ZIP file (you'll have to wait until the Raspbian ZIP file has downloaded completely) then you tell Etcher what drive you want it to write the image file to. If your microSD is not plugged into your computer, do so now then in Etcher select the microSD card. Make sure not to select your Windows hard drive or another USB drive. When Etcher writes the image file to the microSD card, it will erase any information on the microSD card first. So if you accidentally selected your Windows hard drive, you will [brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)) your laptop. Etcher takes a little while to write the image file to the microSD. Once Etcher is done, Windows might prompt you to format the microSD card. Do not format the microSD card. Etcher will create 2 partitions on the microSD card, `boot` and `rootfs`. Windows will be able to read the `boot` partition but will not be able to read the `rootfs`. Windows will want to try to reformat the `rootfs` partition because Windows thinks its corrupt. It's not so don't. If the `boot` partition does not appear under My Computer in your File Explorer, unplug the microSD card from your computer and plug it back in again. You should see a drive called `boot`. At this point, a decision about how you will access the Pi must be made.\n",
