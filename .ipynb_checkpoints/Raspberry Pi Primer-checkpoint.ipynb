    "# Raspberry Pi Primer\n",
    "There are few things to realize before beginning to work with a Raspberry Pi. First, the Pi is a full fledge computer. Computer being the common term of a computer. Not just a device that computes but a computer in the sense of something similar to your laptop or desktop computer. The Arduino is typically described as a computer but it's only a computer in the sense that it is able to compute. This is not the case with the Pi. The second thing to realize about the Pi is that although it is a full fledge computer, it has certain microcontroller characteristics. It has [GPIO pins](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-gpio/gpio-pinout) similar to the Arduino. It is capable of serial, I2C, PWM, and SPI communications. It however does not have an analog to digital converter (ADC). If you need to process an analog signal, you must use a separate ADC to do that (see [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15334) for one/Note: This ADC uses the [QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and you may need additional hardware to use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main ways to use a Pi, using a desktop environment (DE) and using the command line interface (CLI). Below is a quick summary of the pros and cons of using each.\n",
    "## Desktop enironment:\n",
    "### Pro\n",
    "* Very similar to using a regular computer (i.e. mouse and keyboard interactions)\n",
    "* Many programs only work on a DE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Con\n",
    "* Resource heavy (storage space, memory, cpu, etc.)\n",
    "* Often times a DE is not necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command line interface:\n",
    "### Pro\n",
    "* Utilizes little system resources (storage space, memory, cpu, etc.)\n",
    "* More professional\n",
    "\n",
    "### Con\n",
    "* No mouse, you must type everything as a command\n",
    "* Can be quite an adjustment from other computer tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "I would actually encourage just using the CLI. Once you overcome the initial fear of using the CLI, it is not so bad. Regardless of whether you use a DE or the CLI, you will at some point have to using the CLI so you might as well start off with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided whether you are going to go with the DE or CLI, you can go ahead and install the operating system (OS) for the Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Operating System Installation\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "* Raspbian [ZIP file](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)\n",
    "* [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)\n",
    "* &ge; 8GB microSD card\n",
    "* microSD card reader (microSD to USB or microSD to SD adapter)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS that the Pi uses is called Raspbian and is a fork from the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux distribution (Raspberry + Debian = Raspbian). On the Raspbian download page, there are 3 options of download\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster with desktop\n",
    "1. Raspbian Buster Lite\n",
    "\n",
    "Buster is the current version of Raspbian (just like Windows 10 is the current version of Windows operating system). The 3 options are what the names imply. Option 1 comes with the DE and other useful software when using a DE. This option includes software packages like a LibreOffice (think MS Office/Word, Excel, etc.), image editing software, games, etc. Option 1 is good for the case where you are using the Pi as a desktop computer. This option can be a little bloated if you are using the Pi for an embedded system. Option 2 is good for an embedded system where you still want a DE. Option 3 is for the case where you only have the CLI. Whichever option selected be sure to select the `Download ZIP` option. You could down the file via a torrent but that's another lesson. The download could a take a little while to download depending on which version you select. Since the download takes a little while, I typically move the ZIP file to a safe location when it finishes downloading so that I don't have to download it time and time again.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Raspbian ZIP file is downloading, you can download Etcher. Etcher is an image file writer. The zip file that you download is a compressed version of what is called an image file. An image file is \"copy\" of all the files necessary for the OS to work properly. There is more to an image file than simply copying the files from one place to another but that is basically the idea. Etcher handles the \"copying\" of the image file correctly. To use Etcher, you need to first point it to the location of the Raspbian ZIP file (you'll have to wait until the Raspbian ZIP file has downloaded completely) then you tell Etcher what drive you want it to write the image file to. If your microSD is not plugged into your computer, do so now then in Etcher select the microSD card. Make sure not to select your Windows hard drive or another USB drive. When Etcher writes the image file to the microSD card, it will erase any information on the microSD card first. So if you accidentally selected your Windows hard drive, you will [brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)) your laptop. Etcher takes a little while to write the image file to the microSD. Once Etcher is done, Windows might prompt you to format the microSD card. Do not format the microSD card. Etcher will create 2 partitions on the microSD card, `boot` and `rootfs`. Windows will be able to read the `boot` partition but will not be able to read the `rootfs`. Windows will want to try to reformat the `rootfs` partition because Windows thinks its corrupt. It's not so don't. If the `boot` partition does not appear under This PC in your File Explorer, unplug the microSD card from your computer and plug it back in again. You should see a drive called `boot`. At this point, a decision about how you will access the Pi must be made.\n",

    "# Linux Command Line Interface Usage\n",
    "## Command Line Basics ([link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/commands.md))\n",
    "The commands shown on the link are a good starting point to using the CLI. A couple of other things should be mentioned though. First, when typing a command that has a filename in it, you can use press `tab` to auto complete the filename. Sometimes this does not work because there are multiple files with a similar name. For example, if you wanted to change your location to your Desktop, you could type\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd ~/De<tab>`\n",
    "However, the command below would not work\n",
    "`cd ~/D<tab>`\n",
    "This is because there are multiple directories that start with the letter D (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, etc.). The tilde symbol `~` is an alias for your home directory. An alias just means that your can type `~` instead of `/home/pi` to get to your home directory. See here to learn [how](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/bashrc.md) to setup aliases of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing to mention about about the CLI is the up and down arrow key. You can press the up arrow key and it will show the previous command you entered. You can press the up arrow key multiple times to go through all the commands you have entered. The down arrow key cycles to the more recent commands. This is handy when you are running the same command over and over. You don't have to type the command over and over again. You can simply press the up arrow key and then press enter to run the command again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to mention about the CLI is the `.` and `..` keywords. The `.` represents the current working directory. This is your current directory you are working in. This should be displayed by your user name in the CLI. It should appear as something like `pi@raspberrypi ~/Downloads`. So for this CLI prompt, it tells us that the user is `pi`, the computer's name is `raspberrypi`, the current working directory is `~/Downloads` which is just an alias for `/home/pi/Downloads`. In this case `.` is the same thing as `~/Downloads` or `/home/pi/Downloads`. The two dot `..` means the parent directory of your current working directory. So for this example `..` would mean `~` or `/home/pi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crontab Basics ([link](https://www.ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs/))\n",
    "Crontab is a scheduler program on linux OSes. You can schedule an CLI command to run at specific times using crontab. You can also schedule a program to run at startup (that is when the OS first boots up). See [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md) to learn how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GNU nano text editor ([link](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/))\n",
    "Nano is a command line text editor that comes with Raspbian. You can modify any text file will nano. Nano is very powerful if you learn all the shortcuts but probably the most important two are `<ctrl>`+`x` and `<ctrl>`+`o`. `<ctrl>`+`x` closes the file. `<ctrl>`+`o` saves any changes in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## APT Package manager ([link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/apt.md))\n",
    "APT stands for Advanced Package Tool. This is the command you will use to install any new software onto your Pi. The basic usage is `apt` and then a few different keywords. The most common ones are `update`, `upgrade`, and `install`. Linux OSes controller what gets installed on the computer by using an online repository. In very broad terms, a repository is a place where things are stored (like a library). In context of software, it is a place where officially approved versions of software are stored for access by anyone. Since everything that gets placed in the repository gets vetted in somewhere, the chances of malicious code being distributed is reduced (that's not to say it's impossible but the chances are less likely). To use the `update` command with `apt`, you can simply type `apt update` and then press enter. Entering this command gets a list of all the most up to date versions of all the softwares available in the repository. It does not install and new software or update any software already installed on your Pi. It simply checks what is the most up to date version of the available software. The `upgrade` keyword is used to update any installed software on your Pi. You can upgrade all software packages that have a newer version by entering `apt upgrade` or you can update a specific software package by entering `apt upgrade <package name here>`. The `install` keyword allows you to install new software. To install new software you can enter `apt install <package name here>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## sudo command ([link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/root.md))\n",
    "Without going into great detail about different types of users and privileges on Linux OSes, the `sudo` allows your access or do anything you want to on the Pi. It stands for superuser do. The superuser on Linux OSes is known as the root user. If you have ever heard of rooting a phone or device (or jail breaking a phone), it simply means that your have gain root privileges on the device. Often times you must have certain privileges to do certain things on a computer for security reasons. Windows has a similar feature but it calls the superuser the administrator instead of root. To use the `sudo` command, you simply prepend the command that you are trying to execute with `sudo`. For example to install a software package, you more than likely will need root privileges. So to install a software package you can enter `sudo apt install <package name here>`. If you try to execute the command without the `sudo` keyword, it will likely give an error message something about not having sufficient rights or privileges.\n",
